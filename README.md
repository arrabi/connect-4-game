## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd connect-4-game
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

## How to Play

### Game Modes
- **üë• 2 Players**: Classic local multiplayer - take turns on the same device
- **ü§ñ vs AI**: Play against the computer with selectable difficulty

### AI Difficulties
- **üòä Easy**: AI makes random moves - great for learning the game
- **üòê Medium**: AI uses basic strategy - blocks your wins and tries to create its own
- **üòà Hard**: AI uses advanced Minimax algorithm - provides maximum challenge

### Gameplay
1. Choose your game mode using the selector at the top
2. If playing vs AI, select your preferred difficulty level
3. Drop discs by clicking on the columns
4. Get 4 in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) to win!
5. Use the "New Game" button to reset and start over

## Technical Stack

This is a **client-side only** application built with:
- **React.js** - Component-based UI framework
- **Vite** - Fast build tool and dev server
- **CSS** - Styling with animations and responsive design
- **No Backend** - All game logic runs in the browser

### AI Implementation
The AI opponent uses different algorithms based on difficulty:
- **Easy**: Random move selection
- **Medium**: Rule-based heuristics (win detection, blocking)
- **Hard**: Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning (6-move lookahead)

## About

Connect 4 is a two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.

This implementation features both classic 2-player local gameplay and single-player mode against an AI opponent with three difficulty levels. The AI uses different strategies:

- **Easy AI**: Makes random valid moves
- **Medium AI**: Uses basic game theory - blocks opponent wins and creates winning opportunities  
- **Hard AI**: Implements Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning for optimal strategic play

Enjoy playing Connect 4 with friends or challenge yourself against the AI!
