- **Build Tool:** Vite (fast development and optimized production builds)
- **Styling:** CSS Modules or styled-components for scoped styles
- **Animations:** CSS transitions and transforms for smooth visual effects
- **State Management:** React useState/useCallback hooks (sufficient for local game state)

### Development Tools
- **Package Manager:** npm or yarn
- **Testing:** Jest and React Testing Library
- **Version Control:** Git
- **Deployment:** Static hosting (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages)

### No Backend Required
- All game logic runs in the browser
- No server, database, or API endpoints needed
- Game state is maintained in React component state
- Perfect for static hosting and offline play
